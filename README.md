SMPTE ST 2117-10 maps the bitstream for ST2117-1 VC-6 into the MXF Generic Container. The goal of the public CD period is to encourage implementations to discover any issues with the mapping as well as to encourage interoperability between implementations. The initial public CD period is anticipated to be 12 months to allow time for implementations to appear.
